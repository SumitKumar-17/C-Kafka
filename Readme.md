# C-Kafka — Distributed Log System in C

**C-Kafka** is a **distributed log system** written in pure C. This project mimics the core architecture of Apache Kafka — covering **topics**, **partitions**, **message brokers**, **disk-backed logs**, **zero-copy reads**, **memory-mapped I/O**, **thread-to-core mapping**, and **log compression**.

> I have plans to integrate all the parts of the system into making a small version of Kafka. Currenlty this all i wrote so as to understand a lot of internal workings of Kafka, and other things.
> Some part of code is taken from [Kira-Kafka](https://github.com/ROOT-SPROUT/Kira-Kafka). As i used this repository to start and then further add more things into it.
