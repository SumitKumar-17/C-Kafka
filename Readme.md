# C-Kafka — Distributed Log System in C

**C-Kafka** is a **distributed log system** written in pure C. This project mimics the core architecture of Apache Kafka — covering **topics**, **partitions**, **message brokers**, **disk-backed logs**, **zero-copy reads**, **memory-mapped I/O**, **thread-to-core mapping**, and **log compression**.
